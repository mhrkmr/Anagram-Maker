# Anagram-Maker
Created a code to make anagram based sentences from a given vocablary based dictionary. 

The main goal of the project was to create a efficient way to hash the vocablary and then use it to make anagrams. Creativity and efficiency were important as well as the underlying principles of a good and relevant hashing. The required time to access the dictionary must be fast and efficient.

Some sample input and there resultant outputs as generated by the code have been provided in addition to base code file and a few sample vocablary files.
